# Car rent pet-project

Was developed as a pet-project using modern stack of technologies. It is three page web-site with pagination, search form, possibility of choosing product you liked etc. 

Being at "Home page" you can see a wellcome message and button-links which redirect you to "Car page" or "Favorite page". 

Being at "Car page" you can watch all cars (loded by 8 at once), to see more you can use button "load more". As soon as all possible cars will be loaded the button "load more" will disapear. Also at this page exists button "scroll up". Such button is very useful when user already loaded some images and scrolled down watching propositions and decided to use "search form". In this form realized filter by "car brand" and "price per hour", so user can filter as by brand as by price. If user desired get more info about certain car he/she can click on "learn more" button and read additional information about car and rent conditions. Also after click on "learn more" button exist possibility to call and agree rental conditions.
If user not ready to rent a car but liked some so he/she can click on "heart" and add desired car in favorite list (meanwhile the heart will change the color on blue). Clicking on blue "heart" user removes the car from favorite list.

Being at "Favorite page" user can lokk again on the car(s) he/she liked and finilize the order, clicking on "learn more" button and after "rent a car" button.

Enjoy clicking!!!
